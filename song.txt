A warning to the people
The good and the evil
This is war
To the soldier, the civilian
The martyr, the victim
This is war

Its the moment of truth and the moment to lie
The moment to live and the moment to die

The moment to fight, the moment to fight, to fight, to fight, to fight
To the right To the left we will fight to the death
